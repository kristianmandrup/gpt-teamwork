Please now remember the steps:

First lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.
Then output the content of each file, with syntax below.
(You will start with the "entrypoint" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.)
Make sure that files contain all imports, types, variables etc. The code should be fully functional. If anything is unclear, just make assumptions. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the architecture is present in the files.

File syntax:

```filename.ts/html/css
