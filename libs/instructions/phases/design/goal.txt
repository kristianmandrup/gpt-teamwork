The original plan and vision are elaborated into a software design document (SDD) that 
includes the system design, programming language, templates, platform to use, 
and application security measures. 

This is also where you can flowchart how the software responds to user actions.

In most cases, the design phase will include the development of a prototype model. 
C
reating a pre-production version of the product can give the team the opportunity to 
visualize what the product will look like and make changes without having to go 
through the hassle of rewriting code.

The design stage is a necessary precursor to the main developer stage.

Developers will first outline the details for the overall application, alongside specific aspects, 
such as its:

User interfaces
System interfaces
Network and network requirements
Databases

Theyâ€™ll typically turn the SRS document they created into a more logical structure that can 
later be implemented in a programming language. 

Operation, training, and maintenance plans will all be drawn up so that developers know what 
they need to do throughout every stage of the cycle moving forward.

Once complete, development managers will prepare a design document to be referenced 
throughout the next phases of the SDLC.
